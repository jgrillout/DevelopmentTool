easy changes
---------------------

Add validation
	label & field row cant be >24, col>80
	field len cant be >60?
	field type must be 1-5
	Make field name uppercase & cant have spaces but can have _

harder changes
---------------------


add ability to default layout on design screen with F1
change the template  to include my tab order logic?



other issues
----------------------
field required logic not possible with O_NULLOK because it only Controls whether validation is applied to blank fields

if type label in column 2, label column is 1 and should be 2 on adding field to desgin layout 
It is correct if adding field in column>2 




TYPE_NUMERIC RANGES ARE NOT WORKING (NOW I CAN'T REMEMBER WHERE)

Add ability to do insert mode //TRIED BUT I THINK THERE IS A NCURSES BUG
add key delete logic //TRIED BUT I THINK THERE IS A NCURSES BUG
